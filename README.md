# ODU-Fall-2022-Raspberry-Pi-Competition
Note: This repository consists of a project I made for the 3rd Annual Raspberry Pi Competition held at ODU, which acted as extra credit for the class "CS 250". This is being uploaded so that I can have a version of my prior work displayed in a public manner, like a portfolio. This project is based more on the hardware rather than the software.

## [Project](https://github.com/seanallgaier/ODU-Fall-2022-Raspberry-Pi-Competition/releases/tag/ODU-Fall-2022-Raspberry-Pi-Competition-v1.0)
This project consists of a homemade arcade styled controller running on a Raspberry Pi Pico and a retro arcade emulation station running on a Raspberry Pi 4b. The emulation station is using an OS called Recal Box, which allows the emulation of retro video game consoles and arcade machines. The controller is running a software called GP2040-CE. The controller is made out of wood and is using a traditional arcade joystick made by the company Sanwa. The buttons used on the controller have built-in LEDs and are made by Paradise Arcade and EG STARTS.
